<h4 align="center">CSS enclosed in <b>style</b> tags within an HTML document works like a style sheet
external, except that it lives in the HTML document that you design rather than in a separate file, and therefore
it can only be applied to the document you are living in. Please note that this item must be inside
of the <b>head</b> element for HTML validation (although it will work in all current browsers if
placed on the body).</h4>

recommends placing style rules in a style tag or in an external CSS file to maintain a
distinction between content and presentation.
Inline styles override any CSS in an external style sheet or style tag. While
This can be useful in some circumstances, this fact often reduces the ability to
maintenance of a project.
The styles in the following example are applied directly to the elements to which they are associated.</h4>
