<h4 align="center">An external CSS style sheet can be applied to any number of HTML documents by placing a
<link> element in every HTML document.
The rel attribute of the <b> link </b> tag must be set to "style sheet" and the <b> href </b> attribute to the relative path or
absolute to the style sheet. While using relative url paths is generally considered a good
practice, you can also use absolute paths. In HTML5, the type attribute can be omitted.
It is recommended that the <b> link </b> tag be placed in the head tag of the HTML file so that the styles are
load before the elements you design. Otherwise, users will see a flash of unstyled content.</h4>
